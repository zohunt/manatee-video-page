# 🐾 Manatee Video Page

Welcome to the **Manatee Video Page** — a simple, cozy HTML project all about one of the gentlest creatures in the ocean: manatees! This page was created as part of a learning challenge to practice semantic HTML, iframes, and page structure.

## 🌊 What’s Inside

This project includes:

* A `<main>` element as the only child of the `<body>`
* A clear `<h1>` and introductory paragraph
* Three `<section>` elements, each with:

  * An `<h2>` subheading
  * A paragraph introducing the topic
  * An embedded video using `<iframe>` with proper attributes

## 🎥 Featured Topics

1. **Manatee Facts and Biology** – Learn all about their habitat, diet, and anatomy.
2. **Protecting the Florida Manatee** – Explore conservation efforts and how you can help.
3. **Swimming with Manatees** – A peaceful dive into respectful human-manatee encounters.
